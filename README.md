# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Project

In this project we accessed approximately 50 datasets in order to analyse Amazon reviews written by members of the paid [Amazon Vine program](https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help). I performed the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an Amazon Web Services instance and finally loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then we used Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
