# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Project

In this project we analysed Amazon reviews written by members of the paid service [Amazon Vine program](https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help). I performed the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an Amazon Web Services instance and finally loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then we used Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 

__Tools:__ 
- pgAdmin v5
- PySpark 3.1.1
- Amazon RDS

__Datasets:__
- [Amazon pet products dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Pet_Products_v1_00.tsv.gz)

The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement (2 pt)
An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement (2 pt)
